# crud_app
We use CRUD apps every day. Most of the time, without noticing. They keep us organized, they help digitise business processes, and they’re critical to application development. But many of us are oblivious to what CRUD apps are, or how to build one. Within this post, I am to provide you with a simple and straightforward guide to the world of CRUD apps

What is a CRUD App
A CRUD app is a specific type of software application that consists of four basic operations; Create, Read, Update, Delete.

At a high level, CRUD apps consist of three parts; the database, user interface, and APIs.

CRUD operations
As previously mentioned, there are four basic CRUD operations; create, read, update and delete. These four operations map to functions/statements, as seen in the following table:

OPERATIONS	FUNCTIONS
Create	Insert
Read	Select
Update	Update
Delete	Delete
Each letter in CRUD can also be mapped to an HTTP protocol method:

OPERATIONS	HTTP PROTOCOL
Create	Post
Read	Get
Update	Put
Delete	Delete
Let’s dive deeper into each of the CRUD operations. We’ve used a library management app as an example to help with learning.
